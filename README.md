The library is for pixel ring based on APA102, ReSpeaker series pixel ring.

## Hardware
+ ReSpeaker 4 Mic Array or ReSpeaker V2

## Get started
The main controller is `pixel_ring/apa102_pixel_ring.py` but you shouldn't need to change much there. The color profiles are defined in `pixel_ring/pattern.py` and are easy enough to develop your own.
